# Learning Systems Designer in the Making

Hi! I'm John Louis-Strakes Lopez. I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Education at the University of California, Irvine. I study lots of cool things, but they're all centered around a couple of ideas:

+ Learning in Out-of-School Contexts, including:
  + Playful Learning in Public Spaces
  + Games and Learning
+ Executive Function and Learning

I use a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods in my work, including (but not limited to):
+ Learning Analytics 
  + Psychometric Approaches
  + Computational Approaches
+ Design Based Research
  + Design Thinking
  + Participatory Design 
  + Evidence-Centered Design

Lastly, I apply several theoretical frameworks to what I do:
+ Sociocultural Theories
  + Learning as Participation
  + Critical Disability Theory
+ Constructivist Approaches
  + Constructionism

My identity is shaped by several facets.

+ I am a proud Christian
+ I am proudly on the Autism Spectrum
+ I am proudly a first-generation scholar
+ I am proudly a Latino

The purpose of this blog is to share elements of my work that might not be fit for academic publications, yet that I found suitable for publishing for the world to see. I hope to inspire and empower a generation of academics and scholars through my work and what I share with the world.
